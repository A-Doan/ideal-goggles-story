Once, there lived a craftsman. The best craftsman in the world, in fact.
Unmatched by any alive or dead. So great was his craft that the things he
created were not merely great works, but the greatest of all time.
One day, he created a pair of goggles. As these were not merely great goggles,
but the greatest, they showed the truth. Not merely what you could see, like
lesser pairs of goggles, but what was truely there. Unfortunately, this tended
to drive people insane, starting with the craftsman. Then one day, someone found out about the secret goggles he had created!! What would he do next?
